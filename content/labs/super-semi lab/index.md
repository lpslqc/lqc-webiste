The scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) group utilized unique systems capable of measuring devices at cryogenic temperatures and in high magnetic fields, and performing ultra-precise lithography.  Experimental research activities focus on exploring the surfaces of superconductors, magnetic thin films, and performing hydrogen lithography to synthesize devices at the atomic scale.
