Custom superconducting resonators and qubits are studied to better understand coherence, noise, quantum-material properties, et cetera for the future quantum processors. Many studies are performed on atomically sized two-level systems (TLSs), a major source of decoherence. For example, TLS-energy tuning and TLS-sourced microwave lasing are implemented.
