      <description>The quantum world hosts a rich variety of physics that could enable functionality far beyond what traditional technologies can achieve. By probing and manipulating phenomena that occur at the single particle scale, the emerging field of quantum information science (QIS) aims to create new forms of computing, sensing, and communications that could revolutionize how we process and transmit data. The US recently launched the National Quantum Initiative (NQI) to foster collaboration across multiple government agencies in order to strengthen US leadership in QIS and support the next generation of quantum scientists and engineers.</description>

      <description>The scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) group utilized unique systems capable of measuring devices at cryogenic temperatures and in high magnetic fields, and performing ultra-precise lithography. Experimental research activities focus on exploring the surfaces of superconductors, magnetic thin films, and performing hydrogen lithography to synthesize devices at the atomic scale.

      <description>Reversible Logic Macroscopic-quantum phenomena with flux-quanta are explored to lower the energy usage of digital gates in computers. Present-day logic gates use irreversible functions, but physics allows for fundamentally more-efficient reversible gates. Free-dynamical reversible gates are possible using systems of undamped Josephson junctions with complex resonances. Ongoing theoretical and experimental studies of these resonances may lead to dissipationless changes in flux-quanta polarity for the future of computing.

      <description>Can we design qubits with longer coherence times? Is it possible for a time-independent Hamiltonian to prevent noise from decohering a quantum computation? Are there fundamental physical limits to quantumness? These are some of the research questions studied by our group.

      <description>Custom superconducting resonators and qubits are studied to better understand coherence, noise, quantum-material properties, et cetera for the future quantum processors. Many studies are performed on atomically sized two-level systems (TLSs), a major source of decoherence. For example, TLS-energy tuning and TLS-sourced microwave lasing are implemented.

      <description>The quantum superconducting devices group measures at very low temperatures (T ~ 20 mK) a variety of quantum phenomena in circuit QED transmon devices. Our work is broadly focused on understanding 1) the physics of quantum coherent phenomena in these devices and their potential application for quantum computation and 2) the sources of noise that couple to our devices and developing mitigation strategies in an effort to improve the deviceâ€™s coherence time and control fidelities.</description>

      <description>Our primary focus is the development of novel materials and technologies for quantum computer research. Motivated by our previous theoretical work on silicon quantum computer architectures, we are exploring novel approaches to creating semiconductor devices at the atomic scale: we have fabricated and measured the first silicon field effect transistor (FET) devices in which mobile electrons are confined adjacent to a hydrogen terminated silicon surface. These devices have record mobility and exhibit the sixfold valley degeneracy expected on silicon [111].</description>

      <description>Quantum Information Science emerges from the intersection of quantum mechanics and information science and promises new forms of computing, sensing, and networks.
In the Fall of 2018, Agencies and offices across the federal government, including LPS, came together to write a National Strategic Overview for Quantum Information Science. Shortly thereafter, the National Quantum Initiative Act legislated new QIS Research Centers, a quantum industry consortium, and new coordinating bodies (see quantum.gov). The National Defense Authorization Acts of 2019 and 2020 called for a Department of Defense Quantum Information Science Program in support of the national effort, including designation of DOD QIS Research Centers.</description>
